Three things for expressions

1. Syntax
2. Type-checking rules
3. Evaluation rules


Conditionals:
    if e1 then e2 else e3

Type-checking:
    e1 must have type bool, e2 and e3 must have the same type, whatever that maybe
    same as the type of the whole expression

Inteter division
    val v = 2 div 3
