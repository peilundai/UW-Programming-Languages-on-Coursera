Three things for expressions

1. Syntax
2. Type-checking rules
3. Evaluation rules


Conditionals:
    if e1 then e2 else e3


Type-checking:
    e1 must have type bool, e2 and e3 must have the same type, whatever that maybe
    same as the type of the whole expression


Inteter division
    val v = 2 div 3


local bindings, scope with let expressions 
    local variables, 


Language features
    Statically typed or dynamically typed
    No mutation, copies or alias? In ML, it doesn't matter 


Pieces of a Language
    Syntax: a fact to learn
    * Semantics: type checking, and evaluation rules 
    * Idioms: what are the typical patterns for using language features to express your computation
    Libraries: learn on the job
    Tools: learn on the job
