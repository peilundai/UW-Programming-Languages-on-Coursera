Three ways to build compound types
    - each-of (AND): (x, y, z), tuples, int * bool 
    - one-of (OR): take one type of a set of types, e.g. status of a printer. Option: int option, contains an int or it cocntains no data
    - self reference
    
Another way to build each-of compound types 
    - record: each-of 
    - one-of: either an int or string, OOP does one-of types 
    
Syntactic sugar
    - use another way to make things easier: records and tuples
